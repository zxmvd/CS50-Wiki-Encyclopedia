  - If the query matches the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should be redirected to that entryâ€™s page.
  - If the query does not match the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should instead be taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia entries that have the query as a substring.

- Create
  - You can add new page.

- Random page 
  - Will simply return a random page from all pages. 
  
In the main area you'll see the title of all pages. You can click on any of these pages and it will direct you to the page displaying the content of the title.

Entries are stored using Markdown (a markup language), which makes entries more human-friendly to write and edit. It is converted into HTML before displaying it to the user.
