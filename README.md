This is a project from CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course

go to that folder and open cmd
hit ```python manage.py runserver```
Open up the link of localhost url into a browser

You'll see the sidebar containing Search, Create a new page and Random page options and in the main area you'll see the title of all pages.you can click on any of these pages and it will direct you to the page displaying the content of the title.
You can add your own page by going into create new page. Random Page will simply return the one of the pages from all pages.

Any help on implementing the Search and Edit function of the Web-app would be appreciated.
