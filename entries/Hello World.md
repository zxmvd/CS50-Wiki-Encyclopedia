###What is the story behind Hello, World?



Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "hello, world" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards. BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs a few years before the publication of Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972.

###Why Hello, World is famous?

Traditionally, Hello World programs are used to illustrate how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that a language or system is operating correctly. They are usually the first programs that new coders learn, because even those with little or no experience can execute Hello World both easily and correctly.
